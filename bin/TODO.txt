I have a file, which is tab separated, with columns: vault_id, primary_last_modified & vault_full_path

For every line in the file, I must achieve the following two tasks:
  1. Update the last modified timestamp on the filesystem for {vault_full_path} to {primary_last_modified}.
  2. Execute an SQL update statement in the database: `hashes` table, setting `last_modified` to {primary_last_modified} for the record where `id` equals {vault_id}.
 Keep in mind:
  - The {vault_full_path} may contain whitespace characters.
  - Ensure {vault_full_path} exists on the filesystem before proceeding.
  - It would be preferable to execute these operations within a transaction.
