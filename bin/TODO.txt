Tasks that need to be done when listing outdated vault files:
  run ./bin/find-unvaulted-primaries.bash | cut -f 5,8,9
This returns a list of :vault_id, primary_last_modified & vault_full_path
For each result
  1. in fs: set last modified timestamp of {vault_full_path} to the value {primary_last_modified}
  2. in db: run sql update hashes set last_modified = {primary_last_modified} where id = {vault_id}
