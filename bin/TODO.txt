### Find (and update) oudated vault files

This is how to find (and update) vault files that are out of date as compared to the duplicate which is older.

1. List the vault and older duplicate files:
    ```bash
    $ ./bin/find-unvaulted-primaries.bash | cut -f 5,8,9 > all.tsv
    ```
2. Create a file of data to fix them:
    ```bash
    $ ./bin/find-unvaulted-primaries.bash | cut -f 5,8,9 > data-to-fix.tsv
    ```
3. Now run those fixes against the filesystem AND databsae:
    ```bash
    $ ./bin/fix-unvaulted-primaries.bash data-to-fix.tsv
    ```

### View a file(s) via its id in the terminal
    this will use `imgcat` to view the image with the given id in the terminal.
    ```bash
    $ ./bin/viewById.bash 123 [more-ids]
    ```
